// ðŸ§© Start Putting it Together
// Tomorrow is day 7 of 7, and you'll be receiving a final function assignment as well as the task of putting all of your other functions from the week together in sequence.

// If you like, you can get started on piecing together your functions today. Please remember that the functions must be performed on the provided string in order. If you do things out of order it will get messy very fast.

// It is totally up to you how you want to organize your code. Some may choose to create a master decoding function that calls each helper function as needed, while others may prefer to chain the function calls separately. Up to you.

// Note: Day 2 and Day 5 were side-projects, and their real purpose was to provide you with inputs for this final decoding. Day 2's key characters and Day 5's final count will be used as arguments for Day 3 and Day 6's functions, respectively.

// Here's the encrypted string for the week, enjoy!

const encryptedMsg =
  'e!!Igv)t5lltBcvbdeDH3dVw!OOtI#Aa.ZMDu7WYpP^VVjDc4I50iv#ylhgmQfs';
// Do any of you have any guesses about what the message could be? I think it'll stay unsolved until tomorrow, but who knows?
